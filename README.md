# Sparrows-HeritabilityofPersonality

Scripts for work on the heritability of three personality traits in the Lundy House Sparrows.

These scripts accompany the manuscript entitled "Heritability and social brood effects in personality across life stages in a wild passerine".

They are compiled after the first round of reviews, and comprise all code that I wrote for that manuscript but reorganised to be more accessible. I openly acknowledge that there are lots of other versions of these codes in my filesystem from before I encountered version control, file structure, and documentation. I recommend reading the scripts here instead.

As a final note, these files are compiled after my ASReml-R subscription has expired. If someone else would like to run them and tell me if they are compatible with their version, please go ahead.
